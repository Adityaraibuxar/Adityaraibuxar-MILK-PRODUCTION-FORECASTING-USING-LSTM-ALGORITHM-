MILK-PRODUCTION-FORECASTING-USING-LSTM-ALGORITHM
In this Project i used past 13 years milk production data for the forecasting 1 year future production.

In this project i used the LSTM Algorithms.

LSTM:-Long short-term memory (LSTM) units or blocks are part of a recurrent neural network structure. Recurrent neural networks are made to utilize certain types of artificial memory processes that can help these artificial intelligence programs to more effectively imitate human thought.
